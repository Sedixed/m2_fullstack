# M2 fullstack project : API Platform and ReactJS client

## Setup

This project is running using docker containers.
To get started, simply type `docker-compose up --build -d` to build the project and run it.

First execution may take some time as it requires the API and the client to install their
respective dependencies.

Client will then be available at `localhost:4200`, and API at `localhost:8080`.

The API is also fully documented : this documentation may be found at `localhost:8080/api`.
